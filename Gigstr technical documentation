Gigstr Ledger v1.0

Project Codename: Surgical Ledger

Version: 1.0.0 (Build 2026-02-20)

Core Stack: Node.js, React, MySQL, Tailwind CSS (CDN/JIT)1. 

Project Goals

The primary objective of the Gigstr Ledger is to provide a high-performance, high-contrast management interface for touring musicians and event organizers.
Speed of Information: Minimize the "clicks-to-info" ratio.Legibility: Use oversized typography (24px–60px) to ensure readability in low-light environments (backstage/venues).Data Integrity: Prevent accidental modification of past events while allowing full surgical control over future dates.

2. Layout & UI Architecture

The application follows a "Locked Frame" philosophy to ensure the user never feels lost while navigating large data sets.

 2.1 The Global Frame 

(The Sandwich)Header: Persistent navigation bar with high-contrast tracking.
Main Window: A scrollable "Glass" viewport for dynamic content.
Footer: A heavy-weight (oklch) utility bar for system status and settings.

 2.2 The Viewport Logic

The Detail View: Features a "Locked Form Header" where the Event Date and City remain stationary while the technical grid (Load-in, Soundcheck, Contacts) scrolls underneath.The Control Strip: An absolute-positioned cluster in the bottom-right containing a Square Scroll Arrow, a Red Delete Button (Archival logic), and an Electric Orange Save Button.

3. Core Features & Functional Logic

 3.1 Date Handling (Timezone Guard)
To prevent "Date Slippage" (dates moving -1 day due to UTC conversion), the system treats dates as Strings (YYYY-MM-DD) rather than JavaScript Date objects.Archival Trigger: Any date chronologically prior to Today at 00:00 is automatically flagged as // ARCHIVED.Edit Lock: Archived dates disable all POST and DELETE actions, rendering the page "Read-Only."
  
  3.2 HomeView Listings

(Pending Implementation)
The HomeView acts as a "Daily Command Center" using an enhanced accordion-style list.Column Normalization: Automatic stripping of "date" prefixes in headers (e.g., dateCity → CITY).The Accordion: Integrated row expansion to reveal dateDescription without page refreshes.The Quick-Look Modal: A lightweight overlay triggered by an "info" icon to display critical times (Soundcheck/Start) instantaneously.

Future Additions & RefinementsFinancial Stats: A dedicated calculation engine in the footer to show "Total Pending" in both EUR and RSD based on current exchange rates.Conflict Detection: An automated alert system that flags two events scheduled for the same dateDate.System Logs: A viewable history of all "Expunged" items for accidental deletion recovery.Settings Page: Global controls for "Compact Mode" vs "High Visibility Mode" and default currency selection.
